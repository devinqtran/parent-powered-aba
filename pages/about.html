                    <p><strong>At our core we believe in strengthening families and empowering others to succeed.</strong> Unlike popular alternatives where parents pay by the hour, we offer courses, classes, and consultations that will better equip you for facing challenges common to children with autism.</p>
                    <p>Popular behavioral analysis options are costly and outdated with parents paying enormous sums of money for strangers to watch and take care of their kids. Our goal is to eliminate as much outside intrusion as possible by teaching parents real strategies and methods used by professionals.</p>
                    <p>Preparation starts in the home. As parents it is our duty to nourish and care for our children to the best of our abilities.</p>

                    <p>Parent Powered ABA was founded by a behavioral technician and her partner after seeing how costly, intrusive, and unsustainable many ABA therapy options have become. After working within a major ABA provider, we realized that families deserve better—support that empowers parents, rather than replaces them.</p>
                    <p>We started this course to offer a more sustainable, family-first approach to ABA. Our goal is to reduce outside intrusion by equipping parents with the same tools and strategies professionals use—so they can feel confident and capable in supporting their children’s development at home.</p>
                    <p><strong>We believe that real change starts with strong families</strong>. Through affordable courses, consultations, and community support, we’re here to help you become the steady, informed advocate your child needs.</p>
